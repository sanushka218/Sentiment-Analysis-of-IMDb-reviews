im not gonna lie but I felt so self-satisfied after completing this sci-fi movie, it was so exciting, & all elements were so terrific. This sci-fi was a great deal of lots of twist and turns, all theories proved by it was so astonishing and im highly inspired with the effects here. it was exultant. awesome work by the actors, sunny atmosphere created by the effects of movie. but the last element about multiverse was common, and not so shocking!
